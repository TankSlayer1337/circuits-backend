# ASP.NET Core Minimal API Serverless Application

This project shows how to run an ASP.NET Core Web API project as an AWS Lambda exposed through Amazon API Gateway. The NuGet package [Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer) contains a Lambda function that is used to translate requests from API Gateway into the ASP.NET Core framework and then the responses from ASP.NET Core back to API Gateway.


For more information about how the Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer package works and how to extend its behavior view its [README](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-dotnet/blob/master/Libraries/src/Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer/README.md) file in GitHub.

## Executable Assembly ##

.NET Lambda projects that use C# top level statements like this project must be deployed as an executable assembly instead of a class library. To indicate to Lambda that the .NET function is an executable assembly the 
Lambda function handler value is set to the .NET Assembly name. This is different then deploying as a class library where the function handler string includes the assembly, type and method name.

To deploy as an executable assembly the Lambda runtime client must be started to listen for incoming events to process. For an ASP.NET Core application the Lambda runtime client is started by included the
`Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer.Hosting` NuGet package and calling `AddAWSLambdaHosting(LambdaEventSource.HttpApi)` passing in the event source while configuring the services of the application. The
event source can be API Gateway REST API and HTTP API or Application Load Balancer.  

## Here are some steps to follow to get started from the command line:

Once you have edited your template and code you can deploy your application using the [Amazon.Lambda.Tools Global Tool](https://github.com/aws/aws-extensions-for-dotnet-cli#aws-lambda-amazonlambdatools) from the command line.

Install Amazon.Lambda.Tools Global Tools if not already installed.
```
    dotnet tool install -g Amazon.Lambda.Tools
```

If already installed check if new version is available.
```
    dotnet tool update -g Amazon.Lambda.Tools
```

Deploy application
```
    cd "Circuits.Public/src/Circuits.Public"
    dotnet lambda deploy-serverless
```
