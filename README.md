# Circuits-Backend

## Overview

Circuits-Backend is a dynamic exercise planning and logging tool, offering a unique approach to fitness planning that moves beyond traditional fixed-day workout schedules. This work-in-progress application supports the creation of a flexible, user-defined exercise plan organized as a flat, adaptable list, allowing for any-time execution rather than binding users to predefined sessions.

## What Sets Circuits-Backend Apart?

The traditional approach to exercise planning often revolves around fixed schedules, assigning specific exercises to individual days of the week. While this structure can provide a clear routine, it lacks flexibility and doesn't always align well with users' diverse schedules and changing daily commitments.

Circuits-Backend introduces a more adaptable structure. Users define an ordered list of exercises, which can be performed in any order and spread across any desired time frame. This flexible approach caters to the unique lifestyle and goals of each user, ensuring the training plan remains a tool for progress and not a source of stress.

Detailed tracking features further enhance the Circuits experience, logging each completed exercise for comprehensive progress monitoring. This granular tracking empowers users to adapt their training plans effectively based on their performance.

## Repository Contents

This repository houses the backend component of the Circuits application. It contains the necessary data models, API endpoints, and underlying business logic that powers the core functionality of the application.

Note: The corresponding frontend application, which communicates with this backend, resides in a separate repository (link to be added once available).

## Development Stage

Circuits-Backend is currently in the early stages of development. While the work is ongoing, with continuous refinement and functionality improvement, it is not currently ready for external contributions or feedback. However, stay tuned for updates as the project progresses and evolves!
